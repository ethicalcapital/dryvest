# Dryvest Deployment Verification (2025-09-27)

## Objective
Confirm the production Cloudflare Pages deployment at `https://dryvest.pages.dev` reflects commit `d435087` and that recently landed features (contact intake + fact-check exports) behave as expected.

## Environment
- Runner: GitHub Codespaces-style container
- Tools: `curl`, `ping`
- Network egress: Restricted DNS resolution for `*.pages.dev`

## Findings
1. **DNS Resolution Failure**
   - `curl` and `ping` requests to `dryvest.pages.dev` failed with `DNS resolution failure`, preventing retrieval of the SPA bundle or API responses. 【b03aab†L1-L7】【c68ea9†L1-L3】
   - Because the hostname could not be resolved, no browser-based tests (disclaimer gate, mode switching, export downloads, contact form submission, or analytics checks) could be executed from this environment.

2. **Partial HEAD Attempt**
   - A preliminary `curl -I` request returned mixed `200`/`503` headers, suggesting intermediary network handling before the DNS error surfaced. 【f7bd3e†L1-L9】 Further attempts to follow redirects resulted in the DNS failure above.

## Next Steps
- Re-run the verification from a network with working DNS for `*.pages.dev` (e.g., local workstation or CI runner with outbound DNS).
- Once connectivity is available, execute the manual checklist provided in the task (disclaimer gate, Fact Check exports, Quick Brief rail, contact form success/failure paths, analytics beacons).
- Capture browser console/network logs during the session to document the `/api/contact` 204 response and analytics beacon payloads.

## Status
**Blocked** – Unable to validate deployment due to DNS resolution issues within the current environment.
