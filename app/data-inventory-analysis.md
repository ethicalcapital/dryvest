# Dryvest Data Inventory for Three Decoder Modes

## Current Data Assets (157 total nodes)

### Content Types by Volume:
- **Sources**: 57 nodes (36%) - Citations and references
- **Counters**: 33 nodes (21%) - Response arguments to pushback
- **Key Points**: 16 nodes (10%) - Core evidence-based arguments
- **Openers**: 14 nodes (9%) - Context-specific opening statements
- **Next Steps**: 11 nodes (7%) - Implementation guidance
- **Template Snippets**: 9 nodes (6%) - Practical communication guidance
- **Guides**: 9 nodes (6%) - Process frameworks
- **One Pagers**: 6 nodes (4%) - Condensed summaries
- **Policy Statements**: 2 nodes (1%) - Formal policy language

### Current Targeting Structure:
- **Identity**: 9 types (individual, swf, public_pension, corporate_pension, endowment, foundation, insurance, central_bank, government)
- **Audience**: NOW 4 types (individuals, staff, consultants, boards) - UPDATED
- **Level**: 2 types (plain, technical)
- **Venue**: REMOVED - was 9 venue types

## Mode Support Analysis

### 1. QUICK DECODER MODE
**What it needs**: Curated, ready-to-use content based on institutional type + audience
**Current support**: STRONG
- 14 opener nodes targeted by identity type
- 16 key_point nodes with evidence-based arguments
- 9 template_snippet nodes for practical guidance
- 57 source nodes for credibility

**Gap**: Need audience-specific variants (individuals vs staff vs consultants vs boards)

### 2. CUSTOM DECODER MODE
**What it needs**: Modular content library for mix-and-match assembly
**Current support**: EXCELLENT
- All 157 nodes available as building blocks
- Strong variety: openers, key points, counters, sources, templates
- 33 counter nodes for response strategies
- 11 next_step nodes for implementation

**Gap**: Better tagging/categorization for easy selection

### 3. COMPARE MODE
**What it needs**: Parallel content showing institutional differences
**Current support**: MODERATE
- 14 opener nodes show different approaches by identity type
- Key points could show institutional variations
- Sources provide institutional examples

**Gap**: Need explicit comparative structure, side-by-side content

## Refined Audience Mapping

### NEW AUDIENCE CATEGORIES:
1. **Individuals** - Personal investors, activists researching for themselves
2. **Staff** - Internal employees at institutions needing talking points
3. **Consultants** - External advisors who need professional language
4. **Boards** - Decision-makers who need executive-level intelligence

### Content Adaptation Needed:
- **Individuals**: Plain language, activist-focused framing
- **Staff**: Professional but accessible, insider perspective
- **Consultants**: Technical expertise, implementation details
- **Boards**: Executive summary style, fiduciary focus

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Retarget existing nodes** to new audience categories
2. **Create audience-specific variants** of key openers and templates
3. **Build comparative structures** for Compare Mode
4. **Add audience-specific one-pagers** (currently only 6 exist)

### Data Gaps to Fill:
1. **Audience-specific language variants** for same arguments
2. **Comparative tables** showing institutional differences
3. **More one-pagers** for quick reference (target: 20-30)
4. **Implementation timelines** by institution type
5. **Success metrics** and case study summaries

### Mode Optimization:
- **Quick Decoder**: Add audience targeting to existing content
- **Custom Decoder**: Already well-supported, just needs better UX
- **Compare Mode**: Needs new comparative content structure

## Current Strengths:
✅ Strong institutional identity targeting (9 types)
✅ Excellent source material (57 citations)
✅ Good response arguments (33 counters)
✅ Professional implementation guidance (11 next steps)
✅ Evidence-based core arguments (16 key points)

## Key Insight:
The dataset is already well-structured for activist intelligence gathering. The main enhancement needed is audience-specific adaptation of existing high-quality content, not creation of entirely new content categories.
