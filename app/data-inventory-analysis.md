# Dryvest Data Inventory Strategic Analysis

*Generated from comprehensive content dump of 157 nodes across 9 content types*

## Executive Summary

Our data inventory reveals a well-developed activist intelligence system with strong institutional targeting but critical gaps in audience-specific delivery. The content foundation is excellent for professional implementation but needs strategic adaptation for the new four-audience taxonomy.

## Current Data Assets (157 total nodes)

### Content Types by Volume & Strategic Value:
- **Sources**: 57 nodes (36%) - **High Strategic Value**
  - Academic citations, institutional reports, regulatory guidance
  - Key strength: NBIM, AFSC, UN databases provide specialized intelligence
  - Gap: Need individual-focused sources (tool guides, success stories)

- **Counters**: 33 nodes (21%) - **High Strategic Value**
  - Response arguments to common pushback
  - Strong coverage: fiduciary duty, performance, diversification concerns
  - Gap: Audience-specific counter language (board vs individual)

- **Key Points**: 16 nodes (10%) - **Medium Strategic Value**
  - Core evidence-based arguments
  - Strong technical foundation with implementation details
  - Gap: Executive summary variants for board consumption

- **Openers**: 14 nodes (9%) - **High Strategic Value**
  - Institutional identity targeting is excellent
  - Each opener tailored to specific institution type
  - Gap: Audience-level adaptation within institutions

- **Next Steps**: 11 nodes (7%) - **Medium Strategic Value**
  - Implementation roadmaps and practical actions
  - Good process framework coverage
  - Gap: Timeline specificity and role-based assignments

- **Template Snippets**: 9 nodes (6%) - **High Strategic Value**
  - Communication frameworks and venue guidance
  - Strong venue-specific direction (committee, board, written memo)
  - Gap: Email templates and follow-up frameworks

- **Guides**: 9 nodes (6%) - **Low Current Data**
  - Process frameworks (content not shown in dump)
  - Need analysis of what guides exist

- **One Pagers**: 6 nodes (4%) - **Critical Gap**
  - Only 6 summaries for 157+ nodes of content
  - Major opportunity: Should have 20-30 one-pagers

- **Policy Statements**: 2 nodes (1%) - **Niche Value**
  - Formal policy language for institutional adoption
  - Adequate for current needs

### Current Targeting Precision:
- **Identity**: 9 institutional types with excellent differentiation
- **Audience**: 4 types (individuals, staff, consultants, boards) - NEW SCHEMA
- **Level**: 2 complexity levels (plain, technical) - UNDERUTILIZED
- **Venue**: Template snippets preserve venue targeting

## Three Decoder Modes: Detailed Support Analysis

### Mode 1: QUICK DECODER - "Curated Intelligence by Type + Audience"
**Concept**: One-click access to essential talking points for specific institution/audience combinations

**Current Support**: STRONG (75% ready)
- ✅ **Identity Targeting**: 14 opener nodes with institution-specific language
  - Example: "Public plans can use consultant/manager mandates, set tracking-error guardrail" (public_pension)
  - Example: "Individual investors can align personal savings with values using low-cost screened funds" (individual)
- ✅ **Evidence Base**: 16 key points with academic backing + 57 credible sources
- ✅ **Practical Implementation**: 9 template snippets for venue/level guidance
- ✅ **Response Strategy**: 33 counter arguments for common pushback

**Critical Gap**: Audience-specific adaptation within institutions
- Need: "Public pension staff talking points" vs "Public pension board presentation"
- Current state: Institution-focused but not audience-differentiated
- Impact: Users get 75% relevance instead of 95% precision

**Quick Wins**:
1. Adapt existing openers for 4 audience types = 56 new targeted openers
2. Create audience-specific counter arguments from existing 33 counters
3. Add audience tags to existing key points

### Mode 2: CUSTOM DECODER - "Mix-and-Match Intelligence Brief"
**Concept**: Modular content library where activists build their own intelligence packages

**Current Support**: EXCELLENT (90% ready)
- ✅ **Content Variety**: 9 content types provide comprehensive building blocks
- ✅ **Volume**: 157 nodes give substantial selection options
- ✅ **Quality**: Professional sourcing with academic citations
- ✅ **Implementation Focus**: Next steps and templates bridge theory to action

**Minor Gap**: Discovery and categorization UX
- Current: Nodes have basic targeting (identity, audience, level)
- Needed: Rich tagging for content discovery ("performance concerns", "fiduciary language", "quick wins")
- Impact: Takes longer to find the right mix of content modules

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
1. Add thematic tags beyond institutional targeting
2. Create content combinations that work well together
3. Pre-built "starter packs" for common use cases

### Mode 3: COMPARE MODE - "Side-by-Side Institutional Intelligence"
**Concept**: Parallel content showing how approaches differ across institution types

**Current Support**: MODERATE (60% ready)
- ✅ **Institutional Differentiation**: 14 openers show clear institutional differences
  - SWF: "formal ethics process, public rationales, factor-neutral optimization"
  - Endowment: "reflect mission and educational values with transparent criteria"
  - Individual: "align personal savings with shared values, keep steps concrete"
- ✅ **Implementation Variation**: Different next steps for different contexts
- ⚠️ **Comparative Structure**: Content exists but not organized for side-by-side comparison

**Major Gap**: Explicit comparative frameworks
- Current: Individual nodes per institution
- Needed: "Here's how pension funds differ from endowments on fiduciary language"
- Missing: Comparative tables, parallel talking points, institutional hierarchy insights

**Development Priorities**:
1. Create institutional comparison matrices
2. Develop parallel argument structures
3. Build "translation guides" between institutional languages

## Strategic Audience Analysis

### Four-Audience Taxonomy Deep Dive:

**1. INDIVIDUALS** - Personal investors, activists researching for family/friends
- *Risk willingness*: Very High - personal values alignment, no institutional constraints
- *Risk ability*: Low - limited resources, no institutional authority, learning curve
- *Combined profile*: Very High willingness × Low ability = Bold vision, practical limitations
- *Current targeting*: 6 nodes with individual identity tags
- *Content needs*: Jargon-free language, personal action steps, accessible tools
- *Gap analysis*: Strong individual-focused openers, but need more practical guides
- *Example need*: "How to research your 401k options" vs current academic citations

**2. STAFF** - Junior/mid-level employees at institutions (analysts, portfolio managers, compliance officers)
- *Risk willingness*: High - personally motivated to drive change, career advancement through initiative
- *Risk ability*: Medium - can raise ideas internally but limited authority and career vulnerability
- *Combined profile*: High willingness × Medium ability = Aggressive research, cautious execution
- *Seniority context*: Not yet senior enough to make final decisions but positioned to influence and research
- *Current targeting*: Zero explicit staff-audience nodes
- *Content needs*: Internal advocacy language, research talking points, "how to bring this upstairs" strategies
- *Gap analysis*: Critical gap - staff are invisible in current content despite being key influence channel
- *Example need*: "How to build the case internally" vs "How to present to the board" (different risk tolerance)

**3. CONSULTANTS** - External advisors who need professional implementation language
- *Risk willingness*: Very Low - extreme professional reputation risk, multiple client relationships at stake
- *Risk ability*: High - technical expertise, client relationships, industry credibility
- *Combined profile*: Very Low willingness × High ability = Maximum risk aversion, cautious expertise
- *Current targeting*: Some technical-level nodes, but not consultant-specific
- *Content needs*: Client-facing language, implementation frameworks, technical precision
- *Gap analysis*: Technical content exists but not packaged for consultant use
- *Example need*: "Client presentation on exclusion implementation" vs general guidance

**4. BOARDS** - Senior decision-makers with ultimate fiduciary responsibility
- *Risk willingness*: Low - fiduciary duty, regulatory scrutiny, reputational concerns
- *Risk ability*: Very High - final authority, capital control, regulatory protection when compliant
- *Combined profile*: Low willingness × Very High ability = Conservative approach, decisive implementation
- *Seniority context*: Final accountability for decisions; require executive-level intelligence and fiduciary protection
- *Current targeting*: Board meeting venue snippets exist
- *Content needs*: Executive summaries, fiduciary-focused arguments, regulatory compliance frameworks
- *Gap analysis*: Foundation exists but needs board-specific language adaptation that emphasizes risk mitigation
- *Example need*: "5-minute board presentation on fiduciary compliance" vs "detailed research arguments" (different risk tolerance)

### Content Adaptation Framework:

| Content Type | Individual | Staff | Consultant | Board |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|

| **Ability** | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
| **Combined Profile** | Bold vision, practical limits | Aggressive research, cautious execution | Maximum risk aversion, cautious expertise | Conservative approach, decisive implementation |
| **Openers** | Personal savings focus | "Building the internal case" | Client advisory | Fiduciary compliance |
| **Key Points** | Simplified evidence | Research talking points | Technical evidence | Executive summary |
| **Counters** | Personal objections | Internal pushback | Client concerns | Board/regulatory objections |
| **Next Steps** | Personal actions | "How to escalate upstairs" | Client roadmap | Governance decisions |
