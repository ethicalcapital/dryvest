# Conduct Risk Control Framework

Use this template to translate global governance and stewardship standards into an institution-specific program for identifying, assessing, and managing conduct-related investment risk.

## 1. Governance & Tone

- **Board mandate** – reference COSO ERM: clearly assign oversight to the risk or investment committee and describe how conduct risk fits within the overall risk appetite statement.
- **Risk taxonomy** – define product-based screens (e.g., controversial weapons, settlement-linked revenue) and conduct-based triggers (sanctions, human-rights violations, corruption cases).
- **Escalation ownership** – map who owns detection, evaluation, escalation, decision, and documentation (staff, consultants, counsel, trustees).

## 2. Risk Assessment & Inventory

| Component | Description | Owner | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flagged issuers list | Consolidated view of companies captured by campaigns, third-party databases, or internal research | Consultant + CIO staff | Monthly |
| Exposure map | Holdings by asset class, manager, benchmark weight, revenue dependence | Investment analytics | Quarterly |
| Risk scoring matrix | Likelihood × impact using COSO scales; include qualitative notes and data sources | Compliance / Risk | Quarterly + events |

## 3. Control Design

### 3.1 Screening & Optimisation Controls

- **Tracking-error guardrail**: specify optimisation tolerance (≤25 bps) and diversification tests.
- **Implementation workflow**: assign sequencing (freeze buys → phased sell-down → reinvestment), include consultant validation and manager attestations.
- **Override process**: embed override register with rationale, authoriser, start/end dates.

### 3.2 Due Diligence Standards

- **ICMA sustainable finance principles**: for labelled fixed income holdings, validate use of proceeds, project selection, management of proceeds, reporting.
- **OECD RBC six-step loop**: apply to private markets and supply-chain risk (policy embedment, identify/assess, cease/mitigate, track, communicate, remediate).
- **Manager questionnaires**: include conduct-risk due diligence questions, escalation triggers, data sources.

### 3.3 Whistleblowing & Issue Intake

- Align with ISO 37002: multiple channels, independent investigation workflow, anti-retaliation measures, anonymous tracking.
- Document intake-to-resolution timeline targets and reporting expectations to the audit/risk committee.

## 4. Monitoring & Reporting

Create a master reporting matrix that synchronises internal dashboards and committee materials.

| Report | Content | Owner | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conduct risk heatmap | COSO likelihood/impact view of flagged issuers/issues | Risk team | Quarterly |
| Scenario table | Base / mitigated / unmanaged exposures; TE impact; funded-status deltas | Investment staff + consultant | Semi-annual |
| Variance & override log | All IPS deviations and overrides with rationale | Compliance | Quarterly |
| Whistleblower summary | Volume, case status, remediation | Compliance | Semi-annual |
| Public transparency deck | Policy triggers, actions taken, engagement/escalation status | Communications + CIO | Annual |

## 5. Response & Escalation Protocol

- Build a trigger matrix (product, conduct, systemic) that defines mandatory actions (analytics refresh, consultant memo, engagement escalation, divestment vote).
- Include timelines (e.g., 30-day acknowledgement, 90-day board review) and documentation requirements.
- Link to existing stewardship policy escalation ladders and beneficiary communication plans.

## 6. Integration with Policy Documents

- **Investment Policy Statement**: reference conduct criteria, TE budget, override clause, reporting cadence.
- **Committee charters**: specify conduct risk duties for investment, audit/risk, governance, and compensation committees.
- **Beneficiary consultation**: describe how stakeholder preferences inform conduct-risk prioritisation and how feedback loops are maintained.

## Appendices

1. **Data sources** – AFSC Investigate, UN databases, NGO reports, proprietary research vendors.
2. **Template memos** – prudence memo outline, consultant recommendation format, legal review checklist.
3. **Glossary** – definitions for product-based vs. conduct-based screens, systemic vs. idiosyncratic risk, override.

### Usage Tips

- Attach this document whenever Dryvest recommends a conduct-risk assessment or control review.
- Populate the tables before presenting to trustees; include links to underlying data and memos.
- Pair with the Divestment Exposure Assessment model document for a full risk + implementation briefing.
