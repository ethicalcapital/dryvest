## Does Divestment Destroy Portfolios?

Will BDS-related divestment materially harm endowment returns?

::: {.fragment}
- Recent JLens/ADL study claims **$33.2 billion** in foregone returns
- Huge, if true... but is it?
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Today's Goal:** Separate fiduciary fact from advocacy fiction
:::

## What This Presentation Covers

::: {.incremental}
1. **The JLens Claims** - What they found, why it's methodologically invalid
2. **The Spectrum Problem** - Why even valid studies can't prove universal truths
3. **Performance Reality** - What actually happens with professional divestment
4. **Fiduciary Framework** - How to implement exclusions properly
5. **Implementation Guide** - Concrete steps for boards and trustees

# Part 1: The JLens Study Problems

::: {.fragment}
*Note: These are not trivial methodological quibbles - they are fundamental flaws that invalidate the conclusions*
:::

## Problem 0: Selection Bias

::: {.fragment}
- **Method:** "Focused and conservative" approach excluded 38 companies
- **Finding:** 1.8% annual underperformance (11.1% vs 12.9% returns)
- **Projection:** $33.2 billion foregone over 10 years
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**The Selection Issue:** 38 company sample represented 32% of the S&P 500

*[Research note: Verify total companies on underlying lists - many were small/private and excluded from sample]*
:::

## Problem 1: Time Travel Investing

::: {.fragment}
Applied 2024 exclusion list to entire 2014-2024 period
:::

::: {.fragment}
**The Organizations Cited Didn't Exist:**
- Don't Buy into Occupation Coalition: Formed January 2021
- OHCHR Database: First published February 2020
- AFSC Investigate: Launched 2019
:::

::: {.fragment}
This is like claiming you could have shorted Enron in 1995 based on 2001 knowledge
:::

## Problem 2: Statistical Malpractice

::: {.fragment}
- "38 companies excluded and **no other adjustments made**"
- Tracking error of 1.64% - essentially equals claimed underperformance
- No rebalancing, optimization, or professional management
:::

::: {.insight-box}
**Key Insight:** JLens's tracking error (1.64%) explains 91% of their claimed underperformance - proving they modeled incompetent execution, not divestment impact.
:::

## The Study Cannot Be Replicated

::: {.fragment}
JLens won't disclose:
- Data sources
- Rebalancing methodology
- What "no other adjustments" means
- How they weighted remaining holdings
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Non-replicable results are invalid** in both academic and investment contexts.

## The Professional Management Spectrum

::: {.incremental}
- **Active stock-picking:** Concentrated portfolios, embrace tracking error, skill-based returns
- **Optimized indexing:** Factor-neutral rebalancing, minimal tracking error
- **Screened benchmarks:** Purpose-built indexes with exclusions built-in
- **Overlay strategies:** Third-party optimization on top of existing managers
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**All approaches share:** Full investment, professional risk management, tracking error <0.5%
:::

## The Critical Point

::: {.insight-box}
**Even if JLens's approach were credible for index strategy, it wouldn't prove BDS is good or bad for portfolio returns.**

**Why?** There are many ways to manage a portfolio professionally - each with different risk/return profiles.
:::

::: {.fragment}
*Claiming one naive implementation proves universal impact is like saying "cars are dangerous" after testing a car with no brakes*
:::

# Part 3: Performance Reality Check

## What Actually Happens

::: {.fragment}
Professionally managed exclusions track benchmarks within **basis points**, not percentage points.
:::

## Institutional Scorecard

| Institution | Assets | Scope | Return Impact | Risk Controls |
|-------------|--------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **NBIM (Norway)** | $1.4T | 180+ exclusions | +0.44% cumulative | Tracking error 0.3â€“0.5% |
| **UC Regents** | $126B | Fossil fuel divestment | "Financial risk management" | Consultant oversight + phased exit |
| **PFZW / KLP** | $200B+ | Settlement exclusions | Neutral-to-positive | Vendor optimization + quarterly reviews |

## Academic Evidence

::: {.incremental}
- **Trinks & Scholtens (2018):** 90 years of data - divestment "does not significantly impair financial performance"
- **EDHEC (2023):** Professional optimization reduces tracking error by 80-90%
- **Plantinga & Scholtens (2021):** 40-year study finds differences of "a few basis points"
:::

## Why NaÃ¯ve Studies Fail

::: {.incremental}
- **Static lists applied retroactively** ignore point-in-time information sets
- **"No other adjustments"** = fiduciary malpractice (cash drag, sector concentration)
- **Tracking error parity** with claimed losses proves the model was incompetent
:::

---

# Part 4: The Norway Model Framework

*How boards can implement exclusions without breaching fiduciary duty*

## Why Boards Need This Framework

::: {.incremental}
- Turns "divest" into a governance motion with tracking-error discipline
- Shows trustees how to deliver exclusions without breaching prudence
- Mirrors how NBIM, PFZW, and UC Regents structure conduct screens
:::

## Core Decision Framework

### 1. Mandate & Guardrails {.fragment}

::: {.incremental}
- Adopt written conduct criteria referencing international law + credible evidence sources
- Set **tracking-error budget (â‰¤30 bps)** and require factor/sector neutrality
- Delegate execution to CIO/consultants while retaining policy oversight
:::

### 2. Phased Implementation {.fragment}

::: {.incremental}
- **Immediate:** Stop new purchases, log current exposure
- **30-60 days:** Exit via orderly trading schedule (avoid divestment shock)
- **Quarterly:** Certify reinvestment into benchmark-aligned replacements
:::

### 3. Reporting & Transparency {.fragment}

::: {.incremental}
- Publish exclusion rationale, evidence citations, and guardrails
- Require quarterly one-page dashboards (tracking error, factor exposure, progress)
- Create appeals/exception process with time limits and public log
:::

## Implementation Practices that Preserve Returns

::: {.incremental}
- Set explicit tracking-error guardrail (â‰¤30 bps) and require factor/sector neutrality
- Reinvest promptly to avoid cash drag; use screened indexes or optimization overlays
- Phase trades (30â€“60 days) with compliance sign-off to avoid market impact
- Monitor via quarterly analytics (tracking error, factor deltas, contribution to return)
:::

---

# Part 5: Implementation Checklist

## For Board Members & Trustees

### Evidence You Can Cite

::: {.incremental}
- **NBIM (Norway) 2024 Report** â€“ 0.3â€“0.5% tracking error; exclusions added +0.44% cumulative return
- **UC Regents 2020 Fossil Fuel Divestment** â€“ expressly labeled "financial risk management"
- **EDHEC 2023 Optimization Study** â€“ professional rebalancing cuts tracking error by 80â€“90%
:::

### Fiduciary Considerations

::: {.incremental}
1. **Risk Management:** Can exclusions be implemented within acceptable tracking error limits?
2. **Professional Implementation:** Will portfolio management employ optimization techniques?
3. **Stakeholder Alignment:** How do exclusions align with institutional mission?
4. **Performance Monitoring:** What governance ensures ongoing assessment of impact?
:::

## For Staff Implementation

::: {.incremental}
- Update IPS / investment policy statement with conduct language + tracking error budget
- Instruct index/active managers to load exclusion list + optimization constraints
- Coordinate consultant to run pre/post analytics (tracking error, factor tilts, liquidity)
- Document phased trade plan and compliance attestations
- Schedule annual policy review plus event-driven updates
:::

## Minimum Standards for Future Studies

::: {.fragment}
Any credible analysis of divestment impacts should include:
:::

::: {.incremental}
- **Point-in-time exclusion lists** reflecting realistic investor experience
- **Full methodological transparency** enabling independent replication
- **Multiple implementation scenarios** from naive to professionally optimized
- **Multi-period analysis** avoiding cherry-picked market regimes
:::

# Conclusion

## The JLens Study is Invalid Because

::: {.incremental}
1. **Non-replicable methodology** - cannot be verified by third parties
2. **Implementation malpractice** - approach would expose fiduciaries to legal liability
3. **Temporal inconsistency** - applies future information to past decisions
4. **Selection bias** - cherry-picked companies and time period
:::

## What We Know from Real Evidence

::: {.incremental}
- **Norway ($1.4T):** +0.44% from exclusions with 0.3-0.5% tracking error
- **UC System ($126B):** Successful divestment as "risk management"
- **Academic consensus:** Impact measured in basis points, not percentage points
- **Professional management:** Wide spectrum of approaches, most successful
:::

## For Fiduciaries: The Path Forward

::: {.fragment}
Use the Norway Model framework to implement exclusions professionally:
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Set tracking error guardrails (â‰¤30 bps)
- Require factor-neutral optimization
- Phase implementation over 30-60 days
- Publish transparent reporting
- Monitor quarterly with professional analytics
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Bottom Line:** Any trustee considering the JLens study should demand complete methodology disclosure and comparison with actual institutional implementations.
