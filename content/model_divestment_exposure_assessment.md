# Divestment Exposure Assessment

## Purpose

- Document how conduct-based exclusions affect the trust's holdings, risk posture, and plan obligations.
- Provide trustees with a prudence narrative that connects human-rights screens to ERISA/UPMIFA requirements.
- Create a repeatable package: exposure tables, scenario views, and draft policy motions.

## Deliverables Checklist

1. **Exposure Overview**
   - Table of issuers flagged by the coalition (ticker, benchmark weight, dollar exposure, data source).
   - Heatmap showing overlap with index funds, separate accounts, and commingled vehicles.
   - Narrative summary of concentration risks (by asset class, manager, strategy bucket).
2. **Scenario + Tracking Error Analysis**
   - Liability-aware tracking-error estimate (baseline vs. exclusion rebalanced with optimiser).
   - Scenario tables: base case, policy implementation, and "do nothing" risk (carry legal/regulatory shock assumptions).
   - Funded-status sensitivity (bps impact on surplus/deficit and glidepath milestones).
3. **Policy Alignment Packet**
   - Draft IPS/UPMIFA memorandum citing prudence factors (duty of loyalty, duty of care, ERISA §404).
   - Override register template documenting exceptions, time-limits, and sign-off chain.
   - Reporting calendar (quarterly prudence memo, annual exposure refresh, event-driven updates).
4. **Appendices**
   - Source bibliography (AFSC, UN databases, actuarial inputs).
   - Data dictionary so consultants/managers can refresh the analysis in 30 days.
   - Contact sheet for execution (consultant lead, internal PM, compliance).

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Kick-off** – convene sponsor treasury, consultant, CIO office; agree on scope and deliverable dates.
2. **Data Pull** – ingest coalition screening data, manager holdings, benchmark constituents.
3. **Analytics** – run optimisation (tracking error guardrail ≤ 25 bps) and liability stress tests (6–12 month horizon).
4. **Drafting** – compile memo language, populate scenario tables, pre-clear with counsel if needed.
5. **Review** – circulate to investment committee chair and plan counsel; incorporate comments.
6. **Delivery** – present alongside Dryvest brief, secure vote on exposure reduction plan, schedule follow-up.

## How to Use in Dryvest

- Attach this model document when you ask for the exposure assessment in Quick or Custom mode.
- Reference the deliverables checklist in the "Implementation" column so trustees see the full workplan.
- Bundle with fiduciary guardrail templates for a complete decision packet.
