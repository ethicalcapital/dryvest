Feature Basic Win Strong Win Exceptional Win
Basis of Policy A general commitment to consider ESG factors in investment decisions. A formal, public policy with specific negative screens for harmful products and conduct.
A policy explicitly grounded in international human rights law (e.g., UNGPs) and aligned with specific, recognized human rights campaigns.  

Governance An internal committee is tasked with reviewing ESG issues. A formal, documented process for reviewing companies against the policy criteria.
An independent or quasi-independent expert body (like NBIM's Council on Ethics) makes public recommendations based on thorough investigation.  

Transparency The general ESG policy is made public. A list of excluded sectors or general criteria is published.
The full screening methodology, a complete and updated list of all excluded companies, and the specific rationale for each exclusion are made public.  

Human Rights Criteria Vague reference to avoiding "human rights controversies."
Specific criteria for "serious" or "systematic" human rights violations, mirroring the language of international conventions.  

Explicit criteria for violations in conflict zones, complicity in state violence, and other specific, well-defined harms.  

Escalation & Nuance A binary decision to either hold or divest from a company.
The policy includes an intermediate step, such as placing a company on a public "watchlist" or "observation list" for a set period.  

The policy is integrated into a broader stewardship framework that defines a clear escalation ladder from engagement to observation to divestment as a final step.

Tier 1: Procedural & Transparency Wins (The "Getting on the Board" Wins)
These are foundational, process-oriented victories that mark the successful initiation of a substantive engagement. They force the institution to acknowledge the issue and create a baseline for accountability.

Goals:

Secure a formal, time-bound commitment from the investor to conduct a comprehensive review of its human rights risk exposure and existing policies.

Establish a regular, formal channel for dialogue between the activist coalition and a designated response team within the institution.  

Elicit a public statement from the investor acknowledging the legitimacy of the human rights concerns being raised.

Obtain a commitment to enhance transparency regarding the institution's current ESG policies, proxy voting records, and a full list of its public holdings.

Strategic Value: These wins are the essential first step. They move the campaign from the outside to the inside, compelling the institution to expend time and resources on the issue. They grant legitimacy to the activists' concerns and prevent the institution from simply ignoring the campaign. They establish the architecture for future accountability.

Tier 2: Policy & Framework Wins (The "Changing the Rules" Wins)
This tier represents a major strategic victory: shifting from discussing a specific problem to changing the institution's underlying rules of operation.

Goals:

Persuade the investor to adopt a formal, public human rights policy that is explicitly aligned with international standards like the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  

Secure the establishment of a clear set of criteria for screening for "serious or systematic human rights violations," modeled on the conduct-based criteria of the Norges Bank framework  or the transparent methodology of Ethicic.com.  

Achieve a commitment to create a formal, independent, or quasi-independent process for reviewing companies against these criteria, mirroring the concept of NBIM's Council on Ethics.  

Get the investor to formally adopt an escalation policy that includes observation and the potential for exclusion as a tool of last resort.  

Strategic Value: This is the institutionalization of the campaign's core demands. Once these rules are in place, future decisions about specific companies become a matter of applying the agreed-upon policy, not re-litigating the fundamental principle in each case. It creates a permanent mechanism for addressing future human rights issues.

Tier 3: Engagement & Escalation Wins (The "Putting Them on Notice" Wins)
These wins bridge the gap between policy adoption and concrete action. They apply direct and public pressure on specific corporate targets and demonstrate to supporters that the campaign is having a tangible effect.

Goals:

Secure a commitment to place specific, high-priority target companies on a public "observation" or "watchlist," with a clear and public timeline for re-evaluation and potential exclusion.  

Get the investor to commit to an "enhanced engagement" strategy with these watch-listed companies. This strategy must be time-bound and include specific, measurable demands for reform.

Obtain a commitment that failure to meet these demands within the specified timeframe will trigger pre-defined consequences, such as voting against the entire board of directors, filing a shareholder resolution, and moving to the final stage of divestment.  

Strategic Value: These actions make the threat of divestment credible and imminent. They put the target corporations on notice that their conduct is under intense scrutiny from a major investor. For the campaign, this is a clear sign of progress that can be used to mobilize further support and pressure.

Tier 4: Divestment & Exclusion Wins (The "Ultimate Goal" Wins)
This tier represents the fulfillment of the campaign's primary, publicly stated objective. It has the most direct material and reputational impact on the target company and sends the strongest possible signal to the market.

Goals:

Secure a formal, public commitment to fully divest all holdings from one or more of the campaign's high-priority target companies.

Persuade the investor to add a specific category of human rights abuse (e.g., companies operating in illegal settlements, companies providing military equipment to regimes under arms embargoes) to its permanent, product- or conduct-based exclusion list.  

Strategic Value: This is the ultimate victory around which the campaign was built. It directly removes financial support from the target company, inflicts significant reputational damage, and creates a powerful precedent that can be leveraged in campaigns targeting other institutions.
