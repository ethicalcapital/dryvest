## Research Prompts in Progress


### Active manager performance distribution & factor usage

**Context:** Our activist and institutional users keep hearing “our active managers will handle this”—we need hard numbers and a taxonomy of factor claims to rebut vague promises.

**What Dryvest needs:** an evidence pack that explains how active strategies actually perform relative to benchmarks and catalogs the factor narratives managers deploy—from disciplined quantitative premia to hand-wavy thematic overlays.

**Deliverables**
- **Performance distribution study**: compile SPIVA scorecards, Morningstar Active/Passive Barometer, academic meta-analyses (Fama-French, Cremers & Petajisto active share) to show median/percentile excess returns, dispersion, and persistence over 1/3/5/10-year windows by asset class and geography.
- **Cost drag analysis**: quantify fee/transaction drag, including turnover and market-impact estimates; segment by mutual funds, SMAs, hedge funds, and private strategies where data allows.
- **Factor taxonomy**: map manager claims (value, momentum, quality, low vol, ESG overlays, macro themes, thematic “AI/space/exotic”) and classify evidence strength (peer-reviewed, robust backtest, marketing narrative). Flag “ridiculous” claims with enforcement or blow-up examples.
- **Governance checklist**: compile diligence questions committees should pose (replicability, factor crowding, data-mining controls, capacity limits, drawdown management, use of proprietary vs. vendor data).
- **Reporting template**: design a quarterly/annual template that forces managers to disclose factor exposures, hit rates, active share, ex-ante vs ex-post risk, plus a qualitative accountability section activists can drop into board packets.

**Sources to prioritize:** S&P SPIVA, Morningstar, CFA Institute research foundation monographs, BIS papers on crowded trades, SEC enforcement actions on misleading factor claims, academic journals (Journal of Portfolio Management, Financial Analysts Journal), consultant surveys (Callan, Mercer, bfinance).

### Municipal / State Investment Pools (LGIPs)

**Context:** LGIPs sit between retail cash and institutional policy; activists need to know exactly how statutes constrain portfolios before asking for exclusions.

**What Dryvest needs:** a municipal treasury briefing that helps activists and staff set divestment guardrails before they argue over specific issuers.

**Deliverables**
- **Statutory perimeter**: summarize state investment codes, SEC Rule 2a-7 analogs, collateral mandates, and approved counterparty lists that define what LGIPs can hold.
- **Implementation spectrum**: compare conduct-based overlays, approved issuer lists, collateral policy tweaks, and correspondent banking strategies that keep cash programs within statute but responsive to human-rights screens.
- **Motivation matrix**: map how compliance teams, elected officials, and community coalitions frame the “why,” including the “investments align with identity” outcome.
- **Messaging pack**: produce concise briefs for treasurers, city councils, and rating-agency outreach.
- **Quick wins vs. structural shifts**: highlight what can be done with existing custodians versus what requires new RFPs or pooled-cash restructuring.
- **Transparency loop**: document public notice requirements, dashboard practices, and community advisory mechanisms.

**Sources to prioritize:** state treasury manuals, GASB guidance, SEC releases, municipal investment policies, case law on fiduciary obligations in pooled cash funds.

### Central Bank Reserve Portfolios

**Context:** Central banks are hyper-sensitive to independence and liquidity; we need ways to frame conduct-based divestment without triggering accusations of political interference.

**What Dryvest needs:** an educational dossier that respects central bank independence while showing how reserve managers can adopt conduct-based divestment.

**Required sections**
- **Mandate analysis**: dissect price stability, reserve adequacy, statutory independence, and the IMF/BIS playbooks that govern reserve allocation.
- **Implementation spectrum**: outline counterparty exclusions, collateral frameworks, reserve tranching, sustainability-linked deposits, and FX-liquidity implications.
- **Motivation matrix**: translate regulatory risk, internal leadership priorities, and political stakeholder pressure into central-bank-safe language.
- **Governance & communications**: provide sample board minutes, parliamentary testimony framing, and market-signaling guardrails.
- **Risk controls**: address liquidity coverage, FX hedging, sanctions alignment, and reputational risk management.
- **Case snapshots**: profile Norges Bank, ECB green portfolios, and emerging-market experiments.

**Research expectations:** draw on BIS/IMF reports, central-bank annual statements, rating-agency commentary; flag tensions with statutory independence and treaty obligations.

### Sovereign Wealth Funds (Santiago Principles)

**Context:** SWFs are increasingly called on to align with national values while staying credible to global markets; our dataset needs reusable language for those dual mandates.

**What Dryvest needs:** a mission-alignment guide for sovereign wealth funds balancing national policy goals and global market scrutiny.

**Coverage checklist**
- **Governance guardrails**: charters, parliamentary oversight, Santiago Principles implementation.
- **Implementation pathways**: policy overlays, co-investment screens, mandate rewrites, development-finance tie-ins across liquidity buckets.
- **Motivation matrix**: regulatory risk, internal leadership, and public/civil-society expectations with clear “investments align with identity” outcomes.
- **Messaging pack**: briefing notes for fund boards, government sponsors, external managers, and ratings conversations.
- **Risk management**: sanction exposure, geopolitical backlash, return volatility, transparency commitments.
- **Case studies**: detail moves by Norges Bank Investment Management, NZ Super, Temasek, AP Funds, and others.

**Sources to tap:** annual and parliamentary reports, consultant audits (PwC, EY, KPMG sovereign wealth teams), Santiago Principles scorecards, academic analyses on SWF governance.


### Foundations & Divestment Pathways Briefs (ingested)

The foundation/endowment and public-pension playbooks are now represented in the dataset (see nodes `kp_foundation_*`, `kp_public_*`, associated steps/templates/counters).

**Follow-up tasks:**
- Reference these nodes when drafting readiness-question and policy-scaffold bundles so we avoid duplicating language.
- When new briefs arrive (LGIP, central bank, SWF, corporate exposure assessment), ensure playlists cross-link to the existing foundation/public pension scaffolds for consistency.
